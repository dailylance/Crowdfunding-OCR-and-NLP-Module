# OCR Service Improvements for Crowdfunding Data Extraction

## Recent Enhancements

### 1. **Enhanced OCR Accuracy**

- **Image Preprocessing**: Added multiple image preprocessing techniques
  - Contrast enhancement for better text visibility
  - Sharpness enhancement for clearer text edges
  - Grayscale conversion with high contrast
  - Adaptive binarization (black/white) for optimal text separation
- **Multiple Detection Methods**: Each image is processed with 3 different OCR configurations
  - Standard paragraph detection
  - Detailed text detection for small text
  - Aggressive settings for numbers and monetary amounts
- **Multi-reader Approach**: Uses separate EasyOCR readers for better language support
  - English + Japanese reader
  - English + Chinese (Simplified) reader
  - English + Chinese (Traditional) reader
  - English + Korean reader
  - English-only fallback reader

### 2. **Improved NLP Extraction**

- **Smarter Text Cleaning**: Merges split monetary amounts and removes OCR artifacts
- **Enhanced Amount Detection**: Better recognition of funding goals vs. current amounts
- **Context-Aware Extraction**: Uses surrounding text to determine field types
- **Advanced Date Recognition**: Multiple date formats with context detection
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each extraction gets a confidence score for reliability
- **Entity Recognition**: Uses spaCy NER for better person and location extraction

### 3. **New Endpoints**

#### `/v1/debug-ocr` (NEW)

Debug endpoint that provides detailed information about OCR extraction:

- Shows all intermediate OCR results
- Provides extraction confidence scores
- Gives troubleshooting suggestions
- Displays text length and detection statistics

#### Enhanced existing endpoints:

- `/v1/ocr` - Basic OCR with translation
- `/v1/parse-ocr` - OCR + basic NLP parsing
- `/v1/extract-crowdfunding` - Complete crowdfunding data extraction

### 4. **Better Error Handling**

- Fallback OCR methods if primary fails
- Detailed error reporting for debugging
- Graceful degradation when translation fails

## Usage Examples

### Debug OCR Issues

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/debug-ocr" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@your_crowdfunding_image.jpg" \
  -F "translate=true" \
  -F "show_original=true"
```

### Extract Crowdfunding Data

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/extract-crowdfunding" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@your_crowdfunding_image.jpg" \
  -F "translate=true" \
  -F "show_original=false"
```

## Troubleshooting Poor OCR Results

If you're getting poor OCR results like garbled text, try these steps:

### 1. **Image Quality**

- Use high-resolution images (at least 1200px width)
- Ensure good contrast between text and background
- Avoid blurry or low-quality screenshots

### 2. **Image Preprocessing**

- The service now automatically tries 4 different preprocessing methods
- If still poor results, try manually adjusting image contrast before upload

### 3. **Focus on Key Areas**

- Crop the image to focus on the most important information
- Remove unnecessary UI elements that might confuse OCR

### 4. **Use Debug Endpoint**

- The `/v1/debug-ocr` endpoint shows detailed extraction information
- Check `extraction_confidence` score - higher is better
- Review `total_ocr_results_found` to see if text was detected

### 5. **Language Considerations**

- The service automatically detects and handles multiple languages
- Mixed English/Asian text is now better supported
- Translation to English improves NLP extraction accuracy

## Key Improvements for Your Use Case

Based on your example where important crowdfunding data wasn't extracted:

1. **Better Number Recognition**: Enhanced detection of monetary amounts, percentages, and supporter counts
2. **Platform Detection**: Improved recognition of crowdfunding platforms (Indiegogo, Kickstarter, etc.)
3. **Title Extraction**: Smarter project title detection from multiple candidate lines
4. **Date Parsing**: Better date format recognition with context awareness
5. **Amount Classification**: Distinguishes between funding goals and current amounts

## Expected Output Format

The enhanced service now extracts:

```json
{
	"target_site": "Indiegogo",
	"market": "Indiegogo",
	"status": "Live",
	"title": "Project Title from OCR",
	"achievement_rate": "150%",
	"supporters": "1,036",
	"amount": "$265,400",
	"support_amount": "$15,000",
	"extraction_confidence": 0.85,
	"total_ocr_results": 45
}
```

The `extraction_confidence` score helps you understand how reliable the extraction was.
